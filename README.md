# TMHelper
A helper app for Terraformin Mars board game

This app was created using Xamarin (C#, XML). It is my first own Xamarin Android project. I am a first semester computer science student and wanted to get a little taste of mobile development during my winter holidays (That's why the code is still quite chaotic). In my stduies i have so far learned basics of C# and work with Razor Pages. So Android was a completely new area for me. And I am, maybe, going to choose it as an elective course later in the study.

The Terraforming Mars Helper App helps TM players to calculate their final score and store the scores of played games. You have to register(create) a player first in order to create a corporation/player in a game. The backgrund of the player registration is a statistics of played and won games and maximal achieved points in a game. All data (player name, game and different score points) can be edited or deleted, e.g. if mistakes were made. The main page shows the most recently played game and gives direct access to creating a new game. The history view contains all played games. And the player view holds all registered players with their corresponding statistics.
