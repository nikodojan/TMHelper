		Version 1.2:\n- Provisional fix of the award scoring problem: In the last version each player could score either 0, 2 or 5 award points once, which does not comply with the game rules. You can enter the points as a number in a field instead of checking a radio button. (Thanks to the user, who pointed that out. I will also consider your suggestions at a later time.) \n- Other minor bugfixes.
